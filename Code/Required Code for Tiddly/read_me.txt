Code for Microcontroller: 
adc_cali_board
diode_cali
MCP3421

Code for PC IDE:
agilent_34411a
Main_program

1. Run diode_cali on microcontroller. (this will listen for text sent to the serial and give replies based on what's sent)
2. Run Main_program on IDE (I used spyder). Connect to 34411A and microcontroller COM port. (prob will require disconnecting from Thonny)
